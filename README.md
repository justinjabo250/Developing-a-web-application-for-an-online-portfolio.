# Project objective

The goal of this project is to design and develop a web application for an online portfolio that will apartments all of my developed and deployed applications. This will make it simpler for anyone to view all of my works, assignments, and ongoing projects. It will also be simpler for stakeholders, private businesses, and globalÂ international organizations to contact me about any services I can offer them. I genuinely appreciate you contacting me in this manner, and i will be reachable and available for collaboration based on the needs and requirements.
