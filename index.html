									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Fake_News.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>A natural language processing technology called fake news detection is used to find and categorize erroneous or misleading material in news articles and social media posts. The prevalence of fake news has heightened the demand for automated systems that can scan information for possible deception and flag it. In this project, I looked into how to use Hugging Face to polish a pre-trained fake news detection model and distribute it on the Hugging Face model hub.</p>

										<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@jabojustin250/sepsis-prediction-using-fastapi-and-machine-learning-categorization-6b0a5db6805b">Developing A SEPSIS PREDICTION App with the help of machine learning and FastAPI Project.<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/Sepsis_predict.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> Situation: </p> <p> Sepsis remains a critical, time-sensitive medical condition with complex and subtle clinical indicators, making prompt and accurate diagnosis a formidable challenge for healthcare providers seeking to reduce mortality and improve patient outcomes. </p>
									<p> Task: </p> <p> My mission was to design and develop a precise classification model capable of differentiating sepsis from non-sepsis cases by analyzing essential patient metrics—including blood test results, blood pressure, BMI, and age. The goal was to enable healthcare professionals and decision-makers to anticipate sepsis risk early and intervene effectively. </p>
									<p> Action: </p> <p> Utilizing advanced machine learning methodologies and robust Python-based data analytics tools, I meticulously carried out data cleaning, preprocessing, and sophisticated feature engineering to extract hidden patterns and critical predictors from complex, heterogeneous datasets. I employed state-of-the-art classification algorithms, prioritizing model interpretability and precision. To maximize accessibility and scalability, I containerized the model using Docker and deployed it as a FastAPI-based API, ensuring seamless, real-time integration into clinical environments. I translated complex statistical findings into clear, insightful visualizations and reports tailored for diverse stakeholders, including clinicians and healthcare technology investors. </p>
									<p> Result:  </p> <p> The resulting Sepsis Prediction application delivered high classification accuracy and dependability, enabling clinicians to detect sepsis earlier and make informed medical interventions that have the potential to save lives and optimize patient care. The scalable FastAPI deployment promotes broad adoption by healthcare institutions, enhancing clinical workflow integration. </p>

										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Timeseriiess.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> Situation: </p> <p> Corporation Favorita operates in a highly competitive and dynamic retail landscape where accurate, forward-looking insights into store sales patterns are essential for optimizing inventory, promotional strategies, and resource allocation amidst variable influences such as holiday seasons, oil price shifts, and consumer behavior. </p>
									<p> Task: </p> <p> I was commissioned to deeply analyze and integrate multifaceted data sources — including six comprehensive CSV datasets capturing sales, inventory, external events, and economic factors — to uncover hidden relationships, answer key business questions, and build reliable forecasting models that support improved retail decision-making. </p>
									<p> Action: </p> <p> Leveraging advanced data analytics technologies such as Python, Pandas, and specialized time series and regression modeling libraries, I executed rigorous data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis to isolate subtle “hidden dots” and intricate patterns within the data. By incorporating external variables and contextual data (like holidays and oil prices), I enhanced model robustness and predictive accuracy. To effectively communicate insights, I developed intuitive visualizations and data-driven narratives tailored for stakeholders, enabling transparent interpretation and confident decision-making. </p>
									<p> Result: </p> <p> The project delivered highly accurate sales forecasts and uncovered critical factors influencing sales fluctuations, enabling proactive planning, optimized inventory levels, and targeted promotions.
